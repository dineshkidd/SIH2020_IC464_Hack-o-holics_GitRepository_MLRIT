# Sign Language Interpreter
#### By Hack'o'holics

The goal of our project is to create a system that will convert  a person signing in  **Sign Language** into  **text and Voice**. 
We hope to encourage communication between those who have no other way of expressing their ideas other than using Sign Language and those who do not know how to sign.
